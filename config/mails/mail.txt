Dear participant,

 

Thank you for completing the HEAP FAIR data self assessment questionnaire to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) for the scientific community.

The Self Assessment Service statements are based on the FAIR Data Maturity Model, Specification and Guidelines 2020 from the Research Data Alliance.

We will provide a visual summary of your data collection’s “FAIRness level”, showing how well your data and data management practice performs under each FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) category, and highlighting any areas covered in the assessment that need further work.
You will find in the appendix the resulting report, which you can use for your own quality management files as documentation information and as basis for improvement strategies.

For further information about the Self Assessment Service, please contact Bettina Kipperer (bettina.kipperer@medunigraz.at).




Best regards

HEAP WP7
