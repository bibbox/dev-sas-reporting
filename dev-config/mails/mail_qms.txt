Dear Madam, Sir

 

Thank you for completing the BBMRI-ERIC Self-Assessment Survey for general requirements of biobanking activities.

 

You will find in the appendix the resulting report, which you can use for your own quality management files as documented information and as basis for improvement strategies.

 

According to general quality management requirements for biobanking activities, "shall" means a requirement to be fulfilled and "should" a recommendation, to meet the respective requirement of relevant standards for biobanking, this ensures competence in biobanking operations.

 

If your report indicates that your QMS processing complies with relevant standards for biobanking, then you can send the report together with your signed compliance statement to BBMRI-ERIC (sas@bbmri-eric.eu).

 

As a next step, you can specify, if you would like an independent review of your Biobank Quality Management System through the BBMRI-ERIC Quality Management Service (BBMRI.QM Service). Second, you can specify, if you want QMS training provided by the BBMRI.QM Service.

 

These services are provided on demand and can be requested from biobanks within BBMRI-ERIC Member and Observer States and interested parties outside the BBMRI-ERIC community.

 

The purpose of this service is to provide you customized support in improving your quality management of your biobank and, if necessary, to support and assist you on your way to certification by accredited bodies.

 

Best regards
